## 📌 Projects Included

### 🔹 1. Customer Segmentation using K-Means
**Problem:** Businesses struggle to identify high-value customers within large transaction datasets.  
**Solution:** Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.  

**Highlights:**
- Analyzed **400K+ retail transactions**
- Identified **2 meaningful customer segments**
- Found that **22% of customers generate ~80% of revenue**
- Insights indicate **20–30% potential increase in repeat purchases**

**Tech Stack:**  
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 🔹 2. Amazon Product Return Prediction (Classification)
**Problem:** High product return rates increase logistics costs and reduce profitability in e-commerce.  
**Solution:** Built a supervised ML model to predict whether an order will be returned.

**Highlights:**
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** on **10,000+ orders**
- Achieved **95% accuracy** and **0.95 F1-score** (5-fold cross-validation)
- Identified **review rating (39%)** as the top predictor
- Business insights suggest **15–20% reduction in return rates**

**Tech Stack:**  
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
